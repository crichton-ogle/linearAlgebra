In the process of putting the ACM in reduced row echelon form, it is
often desirable to keep track of the precise row operations being
used. For this, some notation is useful. The following summarizes the
notation we have used in class.

\section{Type I operation}

\textbf{What it does:} switches $i^{th}$ and $j^{th}$ rows.

\textbf{Indicated by:} $R_i\leftrightarrow R_j$

\section{Type II operation}

\textbf{What it does:} multiplies $i^{th}$ row by $r\ne 0$.

\textbf{Indicated by:}  $r\cdot R_i$

\section{Type III operation}

\textbf{What it does:} adds $a$ times the $i^{th}$ row to the $j^{th}$ row

\textbf{Indicated by:} $R_j := R_j + a\cdot R_i$ or ``$a\cdot R_i$ added to $R_j$''
